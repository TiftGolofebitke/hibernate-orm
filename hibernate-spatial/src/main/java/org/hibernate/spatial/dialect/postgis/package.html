<p>
	This package contains the spatial extensions for the Postgresql dialect.
</p>
<p>We provide two dialects for postgis</p>
<ul>
    <li>PostgisDialect: this dialect uses the SQL/MM convention for spatial function names (using a 'ST_' prefix).
        It is recommended for use with Postgis version 1.3 or higher</li>
    <li>PostgisNoSQLMM: this dialect does not use the SQL/MM convention. Use it with older, pre-1.3 versions of Postgis</li>
</ul>
