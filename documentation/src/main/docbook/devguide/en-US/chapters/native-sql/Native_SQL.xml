    <title>Native SQL Queries</title>

    <para>
        You may also express queries in the native SQL dialect of your database. This is useful if you
        want to utilize database specific features such as query hints or the CONNECT BY option in Oracle.
        It also provides a clean migration path from a direct SQL/JDBC based application to Hibernate/JPA.
        Hibernate also allows you to specify handwritten SQL (including stored procedures) for all
        create, update, delete, and load operations.
