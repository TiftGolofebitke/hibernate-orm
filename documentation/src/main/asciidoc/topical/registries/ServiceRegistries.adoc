= Services and Registries

Services and Registries are new *as a formalized concept* starting in 4.0.  But the functionality provided by
the Services have actually been around in Hibernate much, much longer.  What is new is the managing them, their
lifecycles and dependencies through a lightweight, dedicated container we call a ServiceRegistry.

This guide aims to describe the design and purpose of these Services and Registries.  To a certain extent we will
also look at details of their implementations.  It will also delve into the ways third-party integrators and
applications can leverage and customize Services and Registries.


== What is a Service?

Services provide various types of functionality, in a pluggable manner.  Specifically they are implementations
of certain service contract interfaces. The interface is known as the service role; the implementation class is
known as the service implementation.  The pluggability comes from the fact that the service implementation adheres
to contract defined by the interface of the service role.

NOTE: All Services are expected to implement the +org.hibernate.service.Service+ "marker" interface.  Hibernate uses
this internally for some basic type safety; it defines no methods (at the moment).

Let's look at an example to better define what a Service is.  Hibernate needs to be able to access JDBC Connections
to the database.  The way it obtains and releases these Connections is through the ConnectionProvider service.  The
service is defined by the interface (service role) +org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi.ConnectionProvider+
which declares methods for obtaining and releasing the Connections.  There are then multiple implementations of that
service contract, varying in how they actually manage the Connections:

* +org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.internal.DatasourceConnectionProviderImpl+ for using a +javax.sql.DataSource+
* +org.hibernate.c3p0.internal.C3P0ConnectionProvider+ for using a C3P0 Connection pool
* etc.

Internally Hibernate always references +org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi.ConnectionProvider+ rather than
specific implementations in consuming the service (we will get to producing the service later when we talk about
registries).  Because of that fact, other ConnectionProvider service implementations could be plugged in.  There is
nothing revolutionary here; programming to interfaces is a generally accepted good programming practice.  What's
interesting is the ServiceRegistry and the pluggable swapping of the different implementors.


== What is a ServiceRegistry?

A ServiceRegistry, at its most basic, hosts and manages Services.  It contract is defined by the
+org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry+ interface.

We already gave a basic overview and definition of services.  But services have other interesting characteristics as
well.  Services have a lifecycle.  They have a scope.  Services might depend on other services.  And as we mentioned
before, they need to be produced (choose using one implementation over another).  The ServiceRegistry fulfills all
these needs.

In a concise definition, the ServiceRegistry acts as a inversion-of-control (IoC) container.

NOTE: Despite some recent revisionist history, Spring did not invent IoC and dependency injection nor were they even
the first to bring it into Java.  Projects like JBoss MicroContainer and Apache Avalon pre-date Spring
by many years and each did IoC and dependency injection.  The concepts in ServiceRegistry are actually very similar
to Apache Avalon.

Why not just use an existing IoC framework?  First, this had to be as light-weight and as small of a footprint
as possible.  The initial design also had called for Services to be swappable at runtime, which unfortunately had
to be removed due to performance problems in the proxy-based solution to swapping (the plan is to investigate
alternate ways to achieve swap-ability with better performance at a later date).

A Service is associated with a ServiceRegistry.  The ServiceRegistry scopes the Service.  The
ServiceRegistry manages the lifecycle of the Service.  The ServiceRegistry handles injecting dependencies into
the Service (actually both a pull and a push/injection approach are supported).  ServiceRegistries are also
hierarchical, meaning a ServiceRegistry can have a parent ServiceRegistry.  Services in one registry can depend on
and utilize services in that same registry as well as any parent registries.

== ServiceBinding

The association of a given Service to a given ServiceRegistry is called a binding and is represented by the
+org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceBinding+ interface.  Furthermore, the specific contract between a ServiceBinding
and the ServiceRegistry is represented by the +org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceBinding.ServiceLifecycleOwner+
interface.

There are 2 ways to associate a Service with a ServiceRegistry.  Either the Service can be directly instantiated
and then handed to the ServiceRegistry, or a ServiceInitiator can be given to the ServiceRegistry (which the
ServiceRegistry will use if and when the Service is needed).  ServiceRegistry implementations (those using the
+org.hibernate.service.internal.AbstractServiceRegistryImpl+ convenience base implementation) register bindings
through calls to the overloaded +AbstractServiceRegistryImpl#createServiceBinding+ method accepting either a Service
instance or a ServiceInitiator instance.

However, each specific ServiceRegistry type has a dedicated builder through which its Services are typically defined
and customized.


== Types of ServiceRegistries

Currently Hibernate utilizes 3 different ServiceRegistry implementations forming a hierarchy.

=== BootstrapServiceRegistry

The root ServiceRegistry is the +org.hibernate.boot.registry.BootstrapServiceRegistry+.  +BootstrapServiceRegistry+
is a specialization of +org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry+.  The +BootstrapServiceRegistry+ interface adds
no new behavior, it is simply a specialization for the purpose of type safety.  In normal usage, the
+BootstrapServiceRegistry+ has no parent.

IMPORTANT: This registry holds services that absolutely have to be available for most things to work.

The +BootstrapServiceRegistry+ normally holds 3 services and is normally built by means of the
+org.hibernate.boot.registry.BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder+ class.  The builder gives type safe access to customizing
these 3 Services.


==== ClassLoaderService

This service exposes the capability to interact with ClassLoaders.  However, the manner in which Hibernate (or any
library) should interact with ClassLoaders varies based on the runtime environment which is hosting the application.
Application servers, OSGi containers, and other modular class loading systems impose very specific class-loading
requirements.  This service is provides Hibernate an abstraction from this environmental complexity.  And just as
importantly, it does so in a single-swappable-component manner.

The specific capabilities exposed on this service include:

* Locating +java.lang.Class+ references by name.  This includes application classes as well as "integration" classes.
* Locating resources (properties files, xml files, etc) as "classpath resources"
* Interacting with +java.util.ServiceLoader+

The service role for this service is +org.hibernate.boot.registry.classloading.spi.ClassLoaderService+.


==== IntegratorService

Applications, third-party integrators and others all need to integrate with Hibernate which used to require something
(usually the application) to coordinate registering the pieces of each integration needed on behalf of each integrator.

TIP: The concept of "Integrator" is still being actively defined and developed as part of the 5.0 codebase.  Expect
changes in these SPIs; in fact those changes are already begun in the repository branch housing 5.0 development.

The IntegratorService manages all known integrators.  There are 2 ways an integrator becomes known.

. The integrator may be manually registered by calling +BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder#with(Integrator)+
. The integrator may be discovered, leveraging the standard Java +java.util.ServiceLoader+
capability provided by the +ClassLoaderService+.  Integrators would simply define a file named
+_/META-INF/services/org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator_+ and make it available on the classpath.
+java.util.ServiceLoader+ covers the format of this file in detail, but essentially it lists classes by FQN that
implement the +org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator+ one per line.

The service role for this service is +org.hibernate.integrator.spi.IntegratorService+.


==== StrategySelector

Think of this as the "short naming" service.  Historically to configure Hibernate users would often need to
give FQN references to internal Hibernate classes.

For example, to tell Hibernate to use JDBC-based transactions we need to tell it to use the
+org.hibernate.engine.transaction.internal.jdbc.JdbcTransactionFactory+ class.  Historically applications would need
to pass in the FQN name of that class as part of the config:

[source]
----
hibernate.transaction.factory_class=org.hibernate.engine.transaction.internal.jdbc.JdbcTransactionFactory
----

Of course this has caused lots of problems as we refactor internal code and move these classes around into different
package structures.  Enter the concept of short-naming, using a well defined and well known "short name" for the
impl class.  For example, this JdbcTransactionFactory is registered under the short name "jdbc", so:

[source]
----
hibernate.transaction.factory_class=jdbc
----

is functionally equivalent to the initial example.  Not only is the second form more concise, it is also upgrade proof.

The short name mappings in this service can be managed, even by applications and integrators which can be very
powerful.  For more information on this aspect, see:

* +BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder#withStrategySelector+
* +BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder#withStrategySelectors+
* Via +ServiceLoader+ discovery under +org.hibernate.boot.registry.selector.StrategyRegistrationProvider+

The service role for this service is +org.hibernate.boot.registry.selector.spi.StrategySelector+.
