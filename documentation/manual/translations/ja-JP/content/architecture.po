msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:44
msgid "We would like to show a more detailed view of the runtime architecture. Unfortunately, Hibernate is flexible and supports several approaches. We will show the two extremes. The \"lite\" architecture has the application provide its own JDBC connections and manage its own transactions. This approach uses a minimal subset of Hibernate's APIs:"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:61
msgid "The \"full cream\" architecture abstracts the application away from the underlying JDBC/JTA APIs and lets Hibernate take care of the details."

You also don't have to worry about transaction demarcation in your code anymore (unless you'd like to write a portable persistence layer of course, use the optional Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal> API for this). You call the <literal>HibernateContext</literal> to access a <literal>Session</literal>."

msgid "Contextual Sessions"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:288
msgid "Most applications using Hibernate need some form of \"contextual\" sessions, where a given session is in effect throughout the scope of a given context. However, across applications the definition of what constitutes a context is typically different; and different contexts define different scopes to the notion of current. Applications using Hibernate prior to version 3.0 tended to utilize either home-grown <literal>ThreadLocal</literal>-based contextual sessions, helper classes such as <literal>HibernateUtil</literal>, or utilized third-party frameworks (such as Spring or Pico) which provided proxy/interception-based contextual sessions."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:297
msgid "Starting with version 3.0.1, Hibernate added the <literal>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal> method. Initially, this assumed usage of <literal>JTA</literal> transactions, where the <literal>JTA</literal> transaction defined both the scope and context of a current session. The Hibernate team maintains that, given the maturity of the numerous stand-alone <literal>JTA TransactionManager</literal> implementations out there, most (if not all) applications should be using <literal>JTA</literal> transaction management whether or not they are deployed into a <literal>J2EE</literal> container. Based on that, the <literal>JTA</literal>-based contextual sessions is all you should ever need to use."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:307
msgid "However, as of version 3.1, the processing behind <literal>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal> is now pluggable. To that end, a new extension interface (<literal>org.hibernate.context.CurrentSessionContext</literal>) and a new configuration parameter (<literal>hibernate.current_session_context_class</literal>) have been added to allow pluggability of the scope and context of defining current sessions."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:314
msgid "See the Javadocs for the <literal>org.hibernate.context.CurrentSessionContext</literal> interface for a detailed discussion of its contract. It defines a single method, <literal>currentSession()</literal>, by which the implementation is responsible for tracking the current contextual session. Out-of-the-box, Hibernate comes with three implementations of this interface."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:324
msgid "<literal>org.hibernate.context.JTASessionContext</literal> - current sessions are tracked and scoped by a <literal>JTA</literal> transaction. The processing here is exactly the same as in the older JTA-only approach. See the Javadocs for details."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:332
msgid "<literal>org.hibernate.context.ThreadLocalSessionContext</literal> - current sessions are tracked by thread of execution. Again, see the Javadocs for details."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:338
msgid "<literal>org.hibernate.context.ManagedSessionContext</literal> - current sessions are tracked by thread of execution. However, you are responsible to bind and unbind a <literal>Session</literal> instance with static methods on this class, it does never open, flush, or close a <literal>Session</literal>."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:347
msgid "The first two implementations provide a \"one session - one database transaction\" programming model, also known and used as <emphasis>session-per-request</emphasis>. The beginning and end of a Hibernate session is defined by the duration of a database transaction. If you use programatic transaction demarcation in plain JSE without JTA, you are adviced to use the Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal> API to hide the underlying transaction system from your code. If you use JTA, use the JTA interfaces to demarcate transactions. If you execute in an EJB container that supports CMT, transaction boundaries are defined declaratively and you don't need any transaction or session demarcation operations in your code. Refer to <xref linkend=\"transactions\"/> for more information and code examples."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:359
msgid "The <literal>hibernate.current_session_context_class</literal> configuration parameter defines which <literal>org.hibernate.context.CurrentSessionContext</literal> implementation should be used. Note that for backwards compatibility, if this config param is not set but a <literal>org.hibernate.transaction.TransactionManagerLookup</literal> is configured, Hibernate will use the <literal>org.hibernate.context.JTASessionContext</literal>. Typically, the value of this parameter would just name the implementation class to use; for the three out-of-the-box implementations, however, there are three corresponding short names, \"jta\", \"thread\", and \"managed\"."
