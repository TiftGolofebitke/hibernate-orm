Unfortunately, we can't use that approach with generated identifiers! Hibernate will only assign identifier values to objects that are persistent, a newly created instance will not have any identifier value! Furthermore, if an instance is unsaved and currently in a <literal>Set</literal>, saving it will assign an identifier value to the object. If <literal>equals()</literal> and <literal>hashCode()</literal> are based on the identifier value, the hash code would change, breaking the contract of the <literal>Set</literal>.
