- Find host for project

- Implement XML overriding of annotation metadata

- Implement access Type rules for XML metadata

- Investigate why it is not possible to use the Filer API to load non class resources, eg
  /META-INF/orm.xml. The API throws a FilerException with the message "Illegal name /META-INF".
  The call is processingEnv.getFiler().getResource((StandardLocation.CLASS_OUTPUT, "/META-INF", "orm.xml" )
  Currently we work around this by using Class.getResourceAsStream()

- Optimize XML parsing by only processing XML files if they have changed since last run (maybe write 
  a tmp file against which to compare the last modified time stamp)

- Reduce the amount of logging and make logging configurable using the possibility to pass arguments to
  the processor using -Akey[=value]

- Write IDE specific plugins which allow to cache processing steps
