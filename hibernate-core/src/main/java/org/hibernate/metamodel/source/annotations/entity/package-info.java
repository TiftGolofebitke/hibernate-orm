package org.hibernate.metamodel.source.annotations.entity;

/**
 * This package contains binding code for entities. In particular it contains classes like {@code ConfiguredClass} and
 * {@code MappedAttribute} which are populated from annotations to make it easier to bind to the Hibernate metamodel.
 * The configured classes (entities) are also ordered in a ways that they can be bound in the right order.
